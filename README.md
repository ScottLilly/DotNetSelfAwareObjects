DotNetSelfAwareObjects is a library that lets you declare initialization and validation rules directly in your business object classes.

<table>
  <tbody>
	<tr>
	  <td>This project is inactive and has been archived to read-only mode. Please contact me if you want it reopened.</td>
	</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Your properties will automatically be set to the declared default values on instantiation.
Your business classes will also have a Validate() method you can call that will check if the properties meet all validation rules.
