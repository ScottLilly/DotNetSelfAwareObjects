DotNetSelfAwareObjects is a library that lets you declare initialization and validation rules directly in your business object classes.

Your properties will automatically be set to the declared default values on instantiation.
Your business classes will also have a Validate() method you can call that will check if the properties meet all validation rules.


If you have questions or suggestions, please contact me at github@scottlilly.com
